        <item>1&lt;b>Rule 4. Summons&lt;/b></item>
        <item>1(a) CONTENTS; AMENDMENTS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Contents.&lt;/i> A summons must:</item>
        <item>3(A) name the court and the parties;</item>
        <item>3(B) be directed to the defendant;</item>
        <item>3(C) state the name and address of the plaintiff’s attorney or—if unrepresented—of the plaintiff;</item>
        <item>3(D) state the time within which the defendant must appear and defend;</item>
        <item>3(E) notify the defendant that a failure to appear and defend will result in a default judgment against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint;</item>
        <item>3(F) be signed by the clerk; and</item>
        <item>3(G) bear the court’s seal.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Amendments.&lt;/i> The court may permit a summons to be amended.</item>
        <item>1(b) ISSUANCE. On or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the summons is properly completed, the clerk must sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons—or a copy of a summons that is addressed to multiple defendants—must be issued for each defendant to be served.</item>
        <item>1(c) SERVICE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> A summons must be served with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for having the summons and complaint served within the time allowed by Rule 4(m) and must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>By Whom.&lt;/i> Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>By a Marshal or Someone Specially Appointed.&lt;/i> At the plaintiff’s request, the court may order that service be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed by the court. The court must so order if the plaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 or as a seaman under 28 U.S.C. § 1916.</item>
        <item>1(d) WAIVING SERVICE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Requesting a Waiver.&lt;/i> An individual, corporation, or association that is subject to service under Rule 4(e), (f), or (h) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons. The plaintiff may notify such a defendant that an action has been commenced and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request must:</item>
        <item>3(A) be in writing and be addressed:</item>
        <item>4(i) to the individual defendant; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) for a defendant subject to service under Rule 4(h), to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process;</item>
        <item>3(B) name the court where the complaint was filed;</item>
        <item>3(C) be accompanied by a copy of the complaint, 2 copies of a waiver form, and a prepaid means for returning the form;</item>
        <item>3(D) inform the defendant, using text prescribed in Form 5, of the consequences of waiving and not waiving service;</item>
        <item>3(E) state the date when the request is sent;</item>
        <item>3(F) give the defendant a reasonable time of at least 30 days after the request was sent—or at least 60 days if sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States—to return the waiver; and</item>
        <item>3(G) be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Failure to Waive.&lt;/i> If a defendant located within the United States fails, without good cause, to sign and return a waiver requested by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court must impose on the defendant:</item>
        <item>3(A) the expenses later incurred in making service; and</item>
        <item>3(B) the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, of any motion required to collect those service expenses.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Time to Answer After a Waiver.&lt;/i> A defendant who, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver need not serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the request was sent—or until 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Results of Filing a Waiver.&lt;/i> When the plaintiff files a waiver, proof of service is not required and these rules apply as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Jurisdiction and Venue Not Waived.&lt;/i> Waiving service of a summons does not waive any objection to personal jurisdiction or to venue.</item>
        <item>1(e) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL WITHIN A JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE UNITED STATES. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual— other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served in a judicial district of the United States by:</item>
        <item>2(1) following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made; or</item>
        <item>2(2) doing any of the following:</item>
        <item>3(A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally;</item>
        <item>3(B) leaving a copy of each at the individual’s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there; or</item>
        <item>3(C) delivering a copy of each to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.</item>
        <item>1(f) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual—other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served at a place not within any judicial district of the United States:</item>
        <item>2(1) by any internationally agreed means of service that is reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents;</item>
        <item>2(2) if there is no internationally agreed means, or if an international agreement allows but does not specify other means, by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:</item>
        <item>3(A) as prescribed by the foreign country’s law for service in that country in an action in its courts of general jurisdiction;</item>
        <item>3(B) as the foreign authority directs in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request; or</item>
        <item>3(C) unless prohibited by the foreign country’s law, by:</item>
        <item>4(i) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) using any form of mail that the clerk addresses and sends to the individual and that requires a signed receipt; or</item>
        <item>2(3) by other means not prohibited by international agreement, as the court orders.</item>
        <item>1(g) SERVING A MINOR OR AN INCOMPETENT PERSON. A minor or an incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States must be served by following state law for serving a summons or like process on such a defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state where service is made. A minor or an incompetent person who is not within any judicial district of the United States must be served in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(f)(2)(A), (f)(2)(B), or (f)(3).</item>
        <item>1(h) SERVING A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, OR ASSOCIATION. Unless federal law provides otherwise or the defendant’s waiver has been filed, a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name, must be served:</item>
        <item>2(1) in a judicial district of the United States:</item>
        <item>3(A) in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an individual; or</item>
        <item>3(B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and—if the agent is one authorized by statute and the statute so requires—by also mailing a copy of each to the defendant; or</item>
        <item>2(2) at a place not within any judicial district of the United States, in any manner prescribed by Rule 4(f) for serving an individual, except personal delivery under (f)(2)(C)(i).</item>
        <item>1(i) SERVING THE UNITED STATES AND ITS AGENCIES, CORPORATIONS, OFFICERS, OR EMPLOYEES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>United States.&lt;/i> To serve the United States, a party must:</item>
        <item>3(A)(i) deliver a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the United States attorney for the district where the action is brought—or to an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee whom the United States attorney designates in a writing filed with the court clerk—or</item>
        <item>3(ii) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the civil-process clerk at the United States attorney’s office;</item>
        <item>3(B) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C.; and</item>
        <item>3(C) if the action challenges an order of a nonparty agency or officer of the United States, send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the agency or officer.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Agency; Corporation; Officer or Employee Sued in an Official Capacity.&lt;/i> To serve a United States agency or corporation, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an official capacity, a party must serve the United States and also send a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the agency, corporation, officer, or employee.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Officer or Employee Sued Individually.&lt;/i> To serve a United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States’ behalf (whether or not the officer or employee is also sued in an official capacity), a party must serve the United States and also serve the officer or employee under Rule 4(e), (f), or (g).</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Extending Time.&lt;/i> The court must allow a party a reasonable time to cure its failure to:</item>
        <item>3(A) serve a person required to be served under Rule 4(i)(2), if the party has served either the United States attorney or the Attorney General of the United States; or</item>
        <item>3(B) serve the United States under Rule 4(i)(3), if the party has served the United States officer or employee.</item>
        <item>1(j) SERVING A FOREIGN, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Foreign State.&lt;/i>A foreign state or its political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality must be served in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1608.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>State or Local Government.&lt;/i> A state, a municipal corporation, or any other state-created governmental organization that is subject to suit must be served by:</item>
        <item>3(A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to its chief executive officer; or</item>
        <item>3(B) serving a copy of each in the manner prescribed by that state’s law for serving a summons or like process on such a defendant.</item>
        <item>1(k) TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant:</item>
        <item>3(A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located;</item>
        <item>3(B) who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from where the summons was issued; or</item>
        <item>3(C) when authorized by a federal statute.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Federal Claim Outside State-Court Jurisdiction.&lt;/i> For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if:</item>
        <item>3(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state’s courts of general jurisdiction; and</item>
        <item>3(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution and laws.</item>
        <item>1(l) PROVING SERVICE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Affidavit Required.&lt;/i> Unless service is waived, proof of service must be made to the court. Except for service by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, proof must be by the server’s affidavit.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Service Outside the United States.&lt;/i> Service not within any judicial district of the United States must be proved as follows:</item>
        <item>3(A) if made under Rule 4(f)(1), as provided in the applicable treaty or convention; or</item>
        <item>3(B) if made under Rule 4(f)(2) or (f)(3), by a receipt signed by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying the court that the summons and complaint were delivered to the addressee.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Validity of Service; Amending Proof.&lt;/i> Failure to prove service does not affect the validity of service. The court may permit proof of service to be amended.</item>
        <item>1(m) TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE. If a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country under Rule 4(f) or 4(j)(1).</item>
        <item>1(n) ASSERTING JURISDICTION OVER PROPERTY OR ASSETS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Federal Law.&lt;/i> The court may assert jurisdiction over property if authorized by a federal statute. Notice to claimants of the property must be given as provided in the statute or by serving a summons under this rule.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>State Law.&lt;/i> On a showing that personal jurisdiction over a defendant cannot be obtained in the district where the action is brought by reasonable efforts to serve a summons under this rule, the court may assert jurisdiction over the defendant’s assets found in the district. Jurisdiction is acquired by seizing the assets under the circumstances and in the manner provided by state law in that district.</item>

        <item>1(a) IN GENERAL. Process—other than a summons under Rule 4 or a subpoena under Rule 45—must be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed for that purpose. It may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of the state where the district court is located and, if authorized by a federal statute, beyond those limits. Proof of service must be made under Rule 4(l).</item>
        <item>1(b) ENFORCING ORDERS: COMMITTING FOR CIVIL CONTEMPT.

        <item>1(a) SERVICE: WHEN REQUIRED.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of the following papers must be served on every party:</item>
        <item>3(A) an order stating that service is required;</item>
        <item>3(B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants;</item>
        <item>3(C) a discovery paper required to be served on a party, unless the court orders otherwise;</item>
        <item>3(D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; and</item>

        <item>2(2) &lt;i>If a Party Fails to Appear.&lt;/i> No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Seizing Property.&lt;/i> If an action is begun by seizing property and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the property when it was seized.</item>
        <item>1(b) SERVICE: HOW MADE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Serving an Attorney.&lt;/i> If a party is represented by an attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Service in General.&lt;/i> A paper is served under this rule by:</item>
        <item>3(A) handing it to the person;</item>
        <item>3(B) leaving it:</item>
        <item>4(i) at the person’s office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person’s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;</item>
        <item>3(C) mailing it to the person’s last known address—in which event service is complete upon mailing;</item>
        <item>3(D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address;</item>

        <item>3(F) delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing—in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Using Court Facilities.&lt;/i> If a local rule so authorizes, a party may use the court’s transmission facilities to make service under Rule 5(b)(2)(E).</item>
        <item>1(c) SERVING NUMEROUS DEFENDANTS.</item>

        <item>3(A) defendants’ pleadings and replies to them need not be served on other defendants;</item>
        <item>3(B) any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirmative defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated as denied or avoided by all other parties; and</item>
        <item>3(C) filing any such pleading and serving it on the plaintiff constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Notifying Parties.&lt;/i> A copy of every such order must be served on the parties as the court directs.</item>
        <item>1(d) FILING.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Required Filings; Certificate of Service.&lt;/i> Any paper after the complaint that is required to be served—together with a certificate of service—must be filed within a reasonable time after service. But disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents or tangible things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>How Filing Is Made—In General.&lt;/i> A paper is filed by delivering it:</item>
        <item>3(A) to the clerk; or</item>
        <item>3(B) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Electronic Filing, Signing, or Verification.&lt;/i> A court may, by local rule, allow papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with any technical standards established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A local rule may require electronic filing only if reasonable exceptions are allowed.

        <item>1(a) NOTICE BY A PARTY. A party that files a pleading, written motion, or other paper drawing into question the constitutionality of a federal or state statute must promptly:</item>
        <item>2(1) file a notice of constitutional question stating the question and identifying the paper that raises it, if:</item>
        <item>3(A) a federal statute is questioned and the parties do not include the United States, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; or</item>
        <item>3(B) a state statute is questioned and the parties do not include the state, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; and</item>
        <item>2(2) serve the notice and paper on the Attorney General of the United States if a federal statute is questioned—or on the state attorney general if a state statute is questioned—either by certified or registered mail or by sending it to an electronic address designated by the attorney general for this purpose.</item>
        <item>1(b) CERTIFICATION BY THE COURT. The court must, under 28 U.S.C. §2403, certify to the appropriate attorney general that a statute has been questioned.</item>
        <item>1(c) INTERVENTION; FINAL DECISION ON THE MERITS. Unless the court sets a later time, the attorney general may intervene within 60 days after the notice is filed or after the court certifies the challenge, whichever is earlier. Before the time to intervene expires, the court may reject the constitutional challenge, but may not enter a final judgment holding the statute unconstitutional.</item>
        <item>1(d) NO FORFEITURE. A party\'s failure to file and serve the notice, or the court\'s failure to certify, does not forfeit a constitutional claim or defense that is otherwise timely asserted.</item>

Unless the court orders otherwise, in an action for benefits under the Social Security Act, and in an action or proceeding relating to an order of removal, to relief from removal, or to immigration benefits or detention, access to an electronic file is authorized as follows:</item>
        <item>2(1) the parties and their attorneys may have remote electronic access to any part of the case file, including the administrative record;</item>
        <item>2(2) any other person may have electronic access to the full record at the courthouse, but may have remote electronic access only to:</item>

A filing that contains redacted information may be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item listed.

        <item>1&lt;b>Rule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to the Court; Sanctions&lt;/b></item>
        <item>1(a) SIGNATURE. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney\'s name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer\'s address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney\'s or party\'s attention.</item>
        <item>1(b) REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person\'s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:</item>
        <item>2(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;</item>
        <item>2(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;</item>
        <item>2(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</item>
        <item>2(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.</item>
        <item>1(c) SANCTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Motion for Sanctions.&lt;/i> A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, incurred for the motion.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>On the Court\'s Initiative.&lt;/i> On its own, the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b).</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Nature of a Sanction.&lt;/i> A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney\'s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Limitations on Monetary Sanctions.&lt;/i> The court must not impose a monetary sanction:</item>
        <item>3(A) against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2); or</item>
        <item>3(B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.</item>
        <item>2(6) Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the sanction.</item>
        <item>1(d) INAPPLICABILITY TO DISCOVERY. This rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions under Rules 26 through 37.</item>

        <item>1(a) TIME TO SERVE A RESPONSIVE PLEADING.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> Unless another time is specified by this rule or a federal statute, the time for serving a responsive pleading is as follows:</item>
        <item>3(A) A defendant must serve an answer:</item>
        <item>4(i) within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) if it has timely waived service under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or within 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States.</item>
        <item>3(B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or crossclaim within 21 days after being served with the pleading that states the counterclaim or crossclaim.</item>
        <item>3(C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days after being served with an order to reply, unless the order specifies a different time.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>United States and Its Agencies, Officers, or Employees Sued in an Official Capacity.&lt;/i> The United States, a United States agency, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an official capacity must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the United States attorney.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>United States Officers or Employees Sued in an Individual Capacity.&lt;/i> A United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States’ behalf must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the officer or employee or service on the United States attorney, whichever is later.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Effect of a Motion.&lt;/i> Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule alters these periods as follows:</item>
        <item>3(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the court\'s action; or</item>
        <item>3(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after the more definite statement is served.</item>
        <item>1(b) HOW TO PRESENT DEFENSES. Every defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion:</item>
        <item>2(1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;</item>
        <item>2(2) lack of personal jurisdiction;</item>
        <item>2(3) improper venue;</item>
        <item>2(4) insufficient process;</item>
        <item>2(5) insufficient service of process;</item>
        <item>2(6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and</item>
        <item>2(7) failure to join a party under Rule 19.</item>
        <item>1A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion.</item>
        <item>1(c) MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.</item>
        <item>1(d) RESULT OF PRESENTING MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PLEADINGS. If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.</item>
        <item>1(e) MOTION FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT. A party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.</item>
        <item>1(f) MOTION TO STRIKE. The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act:</item>
        <item>2(1) on its own; or</item>
        <item>2(2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.</item>
        <item>1(g) JOINING MOTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Right to Join.&lt;/i> A motion under this rule may be joined with any other motion allowed by this rule.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Limitation on Further Motions.&lt;/i> Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.</item>
        <item>1(h) WAIVING AND PRESERVING CERTAIN DEFENSES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>When Some Are Waived.&lt;/i> A party waives any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(2)–(5) by:</item>
        <item>3(A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances described in Rule 12(g)(2); or</item>
        <item>3(B) failing to either:</item>
        <item>4(i) make it by motion under this rule; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>When to Raise Others.&lt;/i> Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:</item>
        <item>3(A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);</item>
        <item>3(B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or</item>
        <item>3(C) at trial.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction.&lt;/i> If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.</item>
        <item>1(i) HEARING BEFORE TRIAL. If a party so moves, any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(1)–(7)—whether made in a pleading or by motion—and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.</item>

        <item>1(a) COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:</item>
        <item>3(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\'s claim; and</item>
        <item>3(B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Exceptions.&lt;/i> The pleader need not state the claim if:</item>
        <item>3(A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the subject of another pending action; or</item>
        <item>3(B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or other process that did not establish personal jurisdiction over the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any counterclaim under this rule.</item>
        <item>1(b) PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIM. A pleading may state as a counterclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not compulsory.</item>
        <item>1(c) RELIEF SOUGHT IN A COUNTERCLAIM. A counterclaim need not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from the relief sought by the opposing party.</item>
        <item>1(d) COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. These rules do not expand the right to assert a counterclaim—or to claim a credit—against the United States or a United States officer or agency.</item>
        <item>1(e) COUNTERCLAIM MATURING OR ACQUIRED AFTER PLEADING. The court may permit a party to file a supplemental pleading asserting a counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading.</item>
        <item>1(f) [Abrogated. ]</item>
        <item>1(g) CROSSCLAIM AGAINST A COPARTY. A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.</item>
        <item>1(h) JOINING ADDITIONAL PARTIES. Rules 19 and 20 govern the addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.</item>
        <item>1(i) SEPARATE TRIALS; SEPARATE JUDGMENTS. If the court orders separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a counterclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing party\'s claims have been dismissed or otherwise resolved.</item>

        <item>1(a) WHEN A DEFENDING PARTY MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Timing of the Summons and Complaint.&lt;/i> A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court\'s leave if it files the third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Third-Party Defendant\'s Claims and Defenses.&lt;/i> The person served with the summons and third-party complaint—the “third-party defendant”:</item>
        <item>3(A) must assert any defense against the third-party plaintiff\'s claim under Rule 12;</item>
        <item>3(B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13a, and may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);</item>
        <item>3(C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff\'s claim; and</item>
        <item>3(D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff\'s claim against the third-party plaintiff.</item>

The third-party defendant must then assert any defense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately.&lt;/i> Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Third-Party Defendant\'s Claim Against a Nonparty.&lt;/i> A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it.</item>
        <item>2(6) &lt;i>Third-Party Complaint In Rem.&lt;/i> If it is within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint may be in rem. In that event, a reference in this rule to the “summons” includes the warrant of arrest, and a reference to the defendant or third-party plaintiff includes, when appropriate, a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property arrested.</item>
        <item>1(b) WHEN A PLAINTIFF MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY. When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Scope of Impleader.&lt;/i> If a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h), the defendant or a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) may, as a third-party plaintiff, bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable—either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff— for remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Defending Against a Demand for Judgment for the Plaintiff.&lt;/i> The third-party plaintiff may demand judgment in the plaintiff\'s favor against the third-party defendant. In that event, the third-party defendant must defend under Rule 12 against the plaintiff\'s claim as well as the third-party plaintiff\'s claim; and the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued both the third-party defendant and the third-party plaintiff.</item>

        <item>3(A) 21 days after serving it, or</item>
        <item>3(B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Other Amendments.&lt;/i> In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\'s written consent or the court\'s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Time to Respond.&lt;/i> Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an amended pleading must be made within the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever is later.</item>
        <item>1(b) AMENDMENTS DURING AND AFTER TRIAL.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Based on an Objection at Trial.&lt;/i> If, at trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\'s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>For Issues Tried by Consent.&lt;/i> When an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties’ express or implied consent, it must be treated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings. A party may move—at any time, even after judgment—to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that issue.</item>
        <item>1(c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>When an Amendment Relates Back.&lt;/i> An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:</item>
        <item>3(A) the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back;</item>
        <item>3(B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading; or</item>
        <item>3(C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:</item>
        <item>4(i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and</item>
        <item>4(ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\'s identity.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Notice to the United States.&lt;/i> When the United States or a United States officer or agency is added as a defendant by amendment, the notice requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and (ii) are satisfied if, during the stated period, process was delivered or mailed to the United States attorney or the United States attorney\'s designee, to the Attorney General of the United States, or to the officer or agency.</item>
        <item>1(d) SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS. On motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.

If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reasonably available by other means to consider possible settlement.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Matters for Consideration.&lt;/i> At any pretrial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on the following matters:</item>
        <item>3(A) formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminating frivolous claims or defenses;</item>
        <item>3(B) amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable;</item>
        <item>3(C) obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on the admissibility of evidence;</item>
        <item>3(D) avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and limiting the use of testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702;</item>
        <item>3(E) determining the appropriateness and timing of summary adjudication under Rule 56;</item>
        <item>3(F) controlling and scheduling discovery, including orders affecting disclosures and discovery under Rule 26 and Rules 29 through 37;</item>
        <item>3(G) identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting dates for further conferences and for trial;</item>
        <item>3(H) referring matters to a magistrate judge or a master;</item>
        <item>3(I) settling the case and using special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule;</item>

        <item>3(N) ordering the presentation of evidence early in the trial on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence, be the basis for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) or a judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c);</item>
        <item>3(O) establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed to present evidence; and</item>
        <item>3(P) facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of the action.</item>
        <item>1(d) PRETRIAL ORDERS. After any conference under this rule, the court should issue an order reciting the action taken. This order controls the course of the action unless the court modifies it.</item>
        <item>1(e) FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE AND ORDERS. The court may hold a final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan, including a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence. The conference must be held as close to the start of trial as is reasonable, and must be attended by at least one attorney who will conduct the trial for each party and by any unrepresented party. The court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.</item>
        <item>1(f) SANCTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> On motion or on its own, the court may issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii), if a party or its attorney:</item>
        <item>3(A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference;</item>

After ratification, joinder, or substitution, the action proceeds as if it had been originally commenced by the real party in interest.</item>
        <item>1(b) CAPACITY TO SUE OR BE SUED. Capacity to sue or be sued is determined as follows:</item>
        <item>2(1) for an individual who is not acting in a representative capacity, by the law of the individual\'s domicile;</item>
        <item>2(2) for a corporation, by the law under which it was organized; and</item>

        <item>1(b) JOINDER OF CONTINGENT CLAIMS. A party may join two claims even though one of them is contingent on the disposition of the other; but the court may grant relief only in accordance with the parties’ relative substantive rights.

        <item>3(A) in that person\'s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or</item>

        <item>4(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Joinder by Court Order.&lt;/i> If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.</item>

        <item>1(b) WHEN JOINDER IS NOT FEASIBLE. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:</item>
        <item>2(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person\'s absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;</item>
        <item>2(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:</item>

        <item>2(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.</item>
        <item>1(c) PLEADING THE REASONS FOR NONJOINDER. When asserting a claim for relief, a party must state:</item>
        <item>2(1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be joined if feasible but is not joined; and</item>
        <item>2(2) the reasons for not joining that person.</item>

        <item>2(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</item>
        <item>2(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;</item>

        <item>1(b) TYPES OF CLASS ACTIONS. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:</item>
        <item>2(1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of:</item>
        <item>3(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or</item>
        <item>3(B) adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;</item>

        <item>3(A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;</item>

        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Altering or Amending the Order.&lt;/i> An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.</item>

        <item>3(A) &lt;i>For (b)(1) or (b)(2) Classes.&lt;/i> For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate notice to the class.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>For (b)(3) Classes.&lt;/i> For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language:</item>
        <item>4(i) the nature of the action;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the definition of the class certified;</item>

        <item>3(B) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include and specify or describe those to whom the Rule 23(c)(2) notice was directed, who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be class members.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Particular Issues.&lt;/i> When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.</item>

        <item>1(d) CONDUCTING THE ACTION.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> In conducting an action under this rule, the court may issue orders that:</item>
        <item>3(A) determine the course of proceedings or prescribe measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in presenting evidence or argument;</item>
        <item>3(B) require—to protect class members and fairly conduct the action—giving appropriate notice to some or all class members of:</item>
        <item>4(i) any step in the action;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the proposed extent of the judgment; or</item>
        <item>4(iii) the members’ opportunity to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or to otherwise come into the action;</item>
        <item>3(C) impose conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors;</item>
        <item>3(D) require that the pleadings be amended to eliminate allegations about representation of absent persons and that the action proceed accordingly; or</item>
        <item>3(E) deal with similar procedural matters.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Combining and Amending Orders.&lt;/i> An order under Rule 23(d)(1) may be altered or amended from time to time and may be combined with an order under Rule 16.</item>
        <item>1(e) SETTLEMENT, VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL, OR COMPROMISE. The claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court\'s approval. The following procedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise:</item>
        <item>2(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.</item>
        <item>2(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.</item>
        <item>2(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.</item>
        <item>2(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.</item>
        <item>2(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be withdrawn only with the court\'s approval.</item>
        <item>1(f) APPEALS. A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered. An appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.</item>
        <item>1(g) CLASS COUNSEL.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Appointing Class Counsel.&lt;/i> Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court that certifies a class must appoint class counsel. In appointing class counsel, the court:</item>
        <item>3(A) must consider:</item>
        <item>4(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action;</item>
        <item>4(ii) counsel\'s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;</item>
        <item>4(iii) counsel\'s knowledge of the applicable law; and</item>
        <item>4(iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class;</item>
        <item>3(B) may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel\'s ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class;</item>
        <item>3(C) may order potential class counsel to provide information on any subject pertinent to the appointment and to propose terms for attorney\'s fees and nontaxable costs;</item>
        <item>3(D) may include in the appointing order provisions about the award of attorney\'s fees or nontaxable costs under Rule 23(h); and</item>
        <item>3(E) may make further orders in connection with the appointment.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Standard for Appointing Class Counsel.&lt;/i> When one applicant seeks appointment as class counsel, the court may appoint that applicant only if the applicant is adequate under Rule 23(g)(1) and (4). If more than one adequate applicant seeks appointment, the court must appoint the applicant best able to represent the interests of the class.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Interim Counsel.&lt;/i> The court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Duty of Class Counsel.&lt;/i> Class counsel must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.</item>
        <item>1(h) ATTORNEY\'S FEES AND NONTAXABLE COSTS. In a certified class action, the court may award reasonable attorney\'s fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties’ agreement. The following procedures apply:</item>
        <item>2(1) A claim for an award must be made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2), subject to the provisions of this subdivision (h), at a time the court sets. Notice of the motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to class members in a reasonable manner.</item>
        <item>2(2) A class member, or a party from whom payment is sought, may object to the motion.</item>
        <item>2(3) The court may hold a hearing and must find the facts and state its legal conclusions under Rule 52(a).</item>
        <item>2(4) The court may refer issues related to the amount of the award to a special master or a magistrate judge, as provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(D).</item>

        <item>1(a) PREREQUISITES. This rule applies when one or more shareholders or members of a corporation or an unincorporated association bring a derivative action to enforce a right that the corporation or association may properly assert but has failed to enforce.

        <item>2(2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\'s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.</item>

        <item>1(a) DEATH.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Substitution if the Claim Is Not Extinguished.&lt;/i> If a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent\'s successor or representative. If the motion is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent must be dismissed.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Continuation Among the Remaining Parties.&lt;/i> After a party\'s death, if the right sought to be enforced survives only to or against the remaining parties, the action does not abate, but proceeds in favor of or against the remaining parties. The death should be noted on the record.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Service.&lt;/i> A motion to substitute, together with a notice of hearing, must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and on nonparties as provided in Rule 4.

If an interest is transferred, the action may be continued by or against the original party unless the court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. The motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).</item>
        <item>1(d) PUBLIC OFFICERS; DEATH OR SEPARATION FROM OFFICE. An action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office while the action is pending. The officer\'s successor is automatically substituted as a party. Later proceedings should be in the substituted party\'s name, but any misnomer not affecting the parties’ substantial rights must be disregarded. The court may order substitution at any time, but the absence of such an order does not affect the substitution.</item>

        <item>3(A) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:</item>
        <item>4(i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;</item>
        <item>4(ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;</item>
        <item>4(iii) a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party—who must also make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and</item>
        <item>4(iv) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34, any insurance agreement under which an insurance business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Proceedings Exempt from Initial Disclosure.&lt;/i> The following proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure:</item>
        <item>3(i) an action for review on an administrative record;</item>

        <item>4(ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award.</item>

In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure.</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Time for Initial Disclosures—For Parties Served or Joined Later.&lt;/i> A party that is first served or otherwise joined after the Rule 26(f) conference must make the initial disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order.</item>
        <item>3(E) &lt;i>Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses.&lt;/i> A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it. A party is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party\'s disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Disclosure of Expert Testimony.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report.&lt;/i> Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party\'s employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:</item>
        <item>4(i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;</item>

        <item>4(i) at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within 30 days after the other party\'s disclosure.</item>
        <item>3(E) &lt;i>Supplementing the Disclosure.&lt;/i> The parties must supplement these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Pretrial Disclosures.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other parties and promptly file the following information about the evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for impeachment:</item>
        <item>4(i) the name and, if not previously provided, the address and telephone number of each witness—separately identifying those the party expects to present and those it may call if the need arises;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony the party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the pertinent parts of the deposition; and</item>
        <item>4(iii) an identification of each document or other exhibit, including summaries of other evidence—separately identifying those items the party expects to offer and those it may offer if the need arises.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Time for Pretrial Disclosures; Objections.&lt;/i> Unless the court orders otherwise, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial. Within 14 days after they are made, unless the court sets a different time, a party may serve and promptly file a list of the following objections: any objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition designated by another party under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(ii); and any objection, together with the grounds for it, that may be made to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(iii). An objection not so made—except for one under Federal Rule of Evidence 402 or 403—is waived unless excused by the court for good cause.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Form of Disclosures.&lt;/i> Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under Rule 26(a) must be in writing, signed, and served.</item>
        <item>1(b) DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Scope in General.&lt;/i> Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\'s claim or defense—including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 26(b)(2)(C).</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Limitations on Frequency and Extent.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>When Permitted.&lt;/i> By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or on the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order or local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests under Rule 36.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Specific Limitations on Electronically Stored Information.&lt;/i> A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>When Required.&lt;/i> On motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by local rule if it determines that:</item>
        <item>4(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or</item>
        <item>4(iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Trial Preparation: Materials.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Documents and Tangible Things.&lt;/i> Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party\'s attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent). But, subject to Rule 26(b)(4), those materials may be discovered if:</item>
        <item>4(i) they are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1); and</item>
        <item>4(ii) the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Protection Against Disclosure.&lt;/i> If the court orders discovery of those materials, it must protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\'s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Previous Statement.&lt;/i> Any party or other person may, on request and without the required showing, obtain the person\'s own previous statement about the action or its subject matter. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order, and Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses. A previous statement is either:</item>
        <item>4(i) a written statement that the person has signed or otherwise adopted or approved; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording—or a transcription of it—that recites substantially verbatim the person\'s oral statement.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Trial Preparation: Experts.</item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Deposition of an Expert Who May Testify.&lt;/i> A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires a report from the expert, the deposition may be conducted only after the report is provided.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Trial-Preparation Protection for Draft Reports or Disclosures.&lt;/i> Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect drafts of any report or disclosure required under Rule 26(a)(2), regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Trial-Preparation Protection for Communications Between a Party\'s Attorney and Expert Witnesses.&lt;/i> Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect communications between the party\'s attorney and any witness required to provide a report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), regardless of the form of the communications, except to the extent that the communications:</item>
        <item>4(i) relate to compensation for the expert\'s study or testimony;</item>
        <item>4(ii) identify facts or data that the party\'s attorney provided and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or</item>
        <item>4(iii) identify assumptions that the party\'s attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Expert Employed Only for Trial Preparation.&lt;/i> Ordinarily, a party may not, by interrogatories or deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial. But a party may do so only:</item>
        <item>4(i) as provided in Rule 35(b); or</item>
        <item>4(ii) on showing exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</item>
        <item>3(E) &lt;i>Payment.&lt;/i> Unless manifest injustice would result, the court must require that the party seeking discovery:</item>
        <item>4(i) pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under Rule 26(b)(4)(A) or (D); and</item>
        <item>4(ii) for discovery under (D), also pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses it reasonably incurred in obtaining the expert\'s facts and opinions.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Claiming Privilege or Protecting Trial-Preparation Materials.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Information Withheld.&lt;/i> When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material, the party must:</item>
        <item>4(i) expressly make the claim; and</item>
        <item>4(ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed—and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Information Produced.&lt;/i> If information produced in discovery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the party making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.</item>
        <item>1(c) PROTECTIVE ORDERS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court where the action is pending—or as an alternative on matters relating to a deposition, in the court for the district where the deposition will be taken. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</item>
        <item>3(A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery;</item>
        <item>3(B) specifying terms, including time and place, for the disclosure or discovery;</item>
        <item>3(C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking discovery;</item>
        <item>3(D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;</item>
        <item>3(E) designating the persons who may be present while the discovery is conducted;</item>
        <item>3(F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on court order;</item>
        <item>3(G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way; and</item>
        <item>3(H) requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the court directs.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Ordering Discovery.&lt;/i> If a motion for a protective order is wholly or partly denied, the court may, on just terms, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.</item>
        <item>3(3) &lt;i>Awarding Expenses.&lt;/i> Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses.</item>
        <item>1(d) TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DISCOVERY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Timing.&lt;/i> A party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by stipulation, or by court order.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Sequence.&lt;/i> Unless, on motion, the court orders otherwise for the parties’ and witnesses’ convenience and in the interests of justice:</item>
        <item>3(A) methods of discovery may be used in any sequence; and</item>
        <item>3(B) discovery by one party does not require any other party to delay its discovery.</item>
        <item>1(e) SUPPLEMENTING DISCLOSURES AND RESPONSES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> A party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission—must supplement or correct its disclosure or response:</item>
        <item>3(A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing; or</item>
        <item>3(B) as ordered by the court.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Expert Witness.&lt;/i> For an expert whose report must be disclosed under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), the party\'s duty to supplement extends both to information included in the report and to information given during the expert\'s deposition. Any additions or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time the party\'s pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.</item>
        <item>1(f) CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES; PLANNING FOR DISCOVERY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Conference Timing.&lt;/i> Except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or when the court orders otherwise, the parties must confer as soon as practicable—and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b).</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Conference Content; Parties’ Responsibilities.&lt;/i> In conferring, the parties must consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case; make or arrange for the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1); discuss any issues about preserving discoverable information; and develop a proposed discovery plan. The attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties that have appeared in the case are jointly responsible for arranging the conference, for attempting in good faith to agree on the proposed discovery plan, and for submitting to the court within 14 days after the conference a written report outlining the plan. The court may order the parties or attorneys to attend the conference in person.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Discovery Plan.&lt;/i> A discovery plan must state the parties’ views and proposals on:</item>
        <item>3(A) what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement for disclosures under Rule 26(a), including a statement of when initial disclosures were made or will be made;</item>
        <item>3(B) the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused on particular issues;</item>
        <item>3(C) any issues about disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information, including the form or forms in which it should be produced;</item>
        <item>3(D) any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials, including—if the parties agree on a procedure to assert these claims after production—whether to ask the court to include their agreement in an order;</item>
        <item>3(E) what changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed; and</item>
        <item>3(F) any other orders that the court should issue under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c).</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Expedited Schedule.&lt;/i> If necessary to comply with its expedited schedule for Rule 16(b) conferences, a court may by local rule:</item>
        <item>3(A) require the parties’ conference to occur less than 21 days before the scheduling conference is held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b); and</item>
        <item>3(B) require the written report outlining the discovery plan to be filed less than 14 days after the parties’ conference, or excuse the parties from submitting a written report and permit them to report orally on their discovery plan at the Rule 16(b) conference.</item>
        <item>1(g) SIGNING DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY REQUESTS, RESPONSES, AND OBJECTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Signature Required; Effect of Signature.&lt;/i> Every disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) or (a)(3) and every discovery request, response, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney\'s own name—or by the party personally, if unrepresented—and must state the signer\'s address, e-mail address, and telephone number. By signing, an attorney or party certifies that to the best of the person\'s knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry:</item>
        <item>3(A) with respect to a disclosure, it is complete and correct as of the time it is made; and</item>
        <item>3(B) with respect to a discovery request, response, or objection, it is:</item>
        <item>4(i) consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law;</item>
        <item>4(ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and</item>
        <item>4(iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Failure to Sign.&lt;/i> Other parties have no duty to act on an unsigned disclosure, request, response, or objection until it is signed, and the court must strike it unless a signature is promptly supplied after the omission is called to the attorney\'s or party\'s attention.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Sanction for Improper Certification.&lt;/i> If a certification violates this rule without substantial justification, the court, on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or both. The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, caused by the violation.</item>

        <item>1&lt;b>Rule 27. Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony&lt;/b></item>
        <item>1(a) BEFORE AN ACTION IS FILED.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Petition.&lt;/i> A person who wants to perpetuate testimony about any matter cognizable in a United States court may file a verified petition in the district court for the district where any expected adverse party resides. The petition must ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to depose the named persons in order to perpetuate their testimony. The petition must be titled in the petitioner\'s name and must show:</item>
        <item>3(A) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in a United States court but cannot presently bring it or cause it to be brought;</item>
        <item>3(B) the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner\'s interest;</item>
        <item>3(C) the facts that the petitioner wants to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons to perpetuate it;</item>
        <item>3(D) the names or a description of the persons whom the petitioner expects to be adverse parties and their addresses, so far as known; and</item>
        <item>3(E) the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Notice and Service.&lt;/i> At least 21 days before the hearing date, the petitioner must serve each expected adverse party with a copy of the petition and a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. The notice may be served either inside or outside the district or state in the manner provided in Rule 4. If that service cannot be made with reasonable diligence on an expected adverse party, the court may order service by publication or otherwise. The court must appoint an attorney to represent persons not served in the manner provided in Rule 4 and to cross-examine the deponent if an unserved person is not otherwise represented. If any expected adverse party is a minor or is incompetent, Rule 17(c) applies.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Order and Examination.&lt;/i> If satisfied that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court must issue an order that designates or describes the persons whose depositions may be taken, specifies the subject matter of the examinations, and states whether the depositions will be taken orally or by written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken under these rules, and the court may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. A reference in these rules to the court where an action is pending means, for purposes of this rule, the court where the petition for the deposition was filed.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Using the Deposition.&lt;/i> A deposition to perpetuate testimony may be used under Rule 32(a) in any later-filed district-court action involving the same subject matter if the deposition either was taken under these rules or, although not so taken, would be admissible in evidence in the courts of the state where it was taken.</item>
        <item>1(b) PENDING APPEAL.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> The court where a judgment has been rendered may, if an appeal has been taken or may still be taken, permit a party to depose witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in that court.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Motion.&lt;/i> The party who wants to perpetuate testimony may move for leave to take the depositions, on the same notice and service as if the action were pending in the district court. The motion must show:</item>
        <item>3(A) the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent; and</item>
        <item>3(B) the reasons for perpetuating the testimony.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Court Order.&lt;/i> If the court finds that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court may permit the depositions to be taken and may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. The depositions may be taken and used as any other deposition taken in a pending district-court action.</item>
        <item>1(c) PERPETUATION BY AN ACTION. This rule does not limit a court\'s power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> Within the United States or a territory or insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a deposition must be taken before:</item>
        <item>3(A) an officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or</item>
        <item>3(B) a person appointed by the court where the action is pending to administer oaths and take testimony.</item>

        <item>1(b) IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> A deposition may be taken in a foreign country:</item>

        <item>3(A) on appropriate terms after an application and notice of it; and</item>
        <item>3(B) without a showing that taking the deposition in another manner is impracticable or inconvenient.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Form of a Request, Notice, or Commission.&lt;/i> When a letter of request or any other device is used according to a treaty or convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. A letter of request may be addressed “To the Appropriate Authority in [name of country].” A deposition notice or a commission must designate by name or descriptive title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Letter of Request—Admitting Evidence.&lt;/i> Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States.</item>
        <item>1(c) DISQUALIFICATION. A deposition must not be taken before a person who is any party\'s relative, employee, or attorney; who is related to or employed by any party\'s attorney; or who is financially interested in the action.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Without Leave.&lt;/i> A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 30(a)(2). The deponent\'s attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>With Leave.&lt;/i> A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(2):</item>
        <item>3(A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:</item>
        <item>4(i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions being taken under this rule or Rule 31 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or</item>
        <item>4(iii) the party seeks to take the deposition before the time specified in Rule 26(d), unless the party certifies in the notice, with supporting facts, that the deponent is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country after that time; or</item>
        <item>3(B) if the deponent is confined in prison.</item>
        <item>1(b) NOTICE OF THE DEPOSITION; OTHER FORMAL REQUIREMENTS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Notice in General.&lt;/i> A party who wants to depose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent\'s name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Producing Documents.&lt;/i> If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the deponent, the materials designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request under Rule 34 to produce documents and tangible things at the deposition.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Method of Recording.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Method Stated in the Notice.&lt;/i> The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Additional Method.&lt;/i> With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>By Remote Means.&lt;/i> The parties may stipulate—or the court may on motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Officer\'s Duties.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Before the Deposition.&lt;/i> Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under Rule 28. The officer must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:</item>
        <item>4(i) the officer\'s name and business address;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the date, time, and place of the deposition;</item>
        <item>4(iii) the deponent\'s name;</item>
        <item>4(iv) the officer\'s administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and</item>
        <item>4(v) the identity of all persons present.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Conducting the Deposition; Avoiding Distortion.&lt;/i> If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)–(iii) at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent\'s and attorneys’ appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>After the Deposition.&lt;/i> At the end of a deposition, the officer must state on the record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.</item>
        <item>2(6) &lt;i>Notice or Subpoena Directed to an Organization.&lt;/i> In its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must then designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to make this designation. The persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.</item>
        <item>1(c) EXAMINATION AND CROSS-EXAMINATION; RECORD OF THE EXAMINATION; OBJECTIONS; WRITTEN QUESTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Examination and Cross-Examination.&lt;/i> The examination and cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, except Rules 103 and 615. After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the officer must record the testimony by the method designated under Rule 30(b)(3)(A). The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Objections.&lt;/i> An objection at the time of the examination—whether to evidence, to a party\'s conduct, to the officer\'s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Participating Through Written Questions.&lt;/i> Instead of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers verbatim.</item>
        <item>1(d) DURATION; SANCTION; MOTION TO TERMINATE OR LIMIT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Duration.&lt;/i> Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Sanction.&lt;/i> The court may impose an appropriate sanction—including the reasonable expenses and attorney\'s fees incurred by any party—on a person who impedes, delays, or frustrates the fair examination of the deponent.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Motion to Terminate or Limit.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Grounds.&lt;/i> At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.

        <item>3(A) the party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or had reasonable notice of it;</item>
        <item>3(B) it is used to the extent it would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence if the deponent were present and testifying; and</item>
        <item>3(C) the use is allowed by Rule 32(a)(2) through (8).</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Impeachment and Other Uses.&lt;/i> Any party may use a deposition to contradict or impeach the testimony given by the deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Deposition of Party, Agent, or Designee.&lt;/i> An adverse party may use for any purpose the deposition of a party or anyone who, when deposed, was the party\'s officer, director, managing agent, or designee under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4).</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Unavailable Witness.&lt;/i> A party may use for any purpose the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the court finds:</item>
        <item>3(A) that the witness is dead;</item>
        <item>3(B) that the witness is more than 100 miles from the place of hearing or trial or is outside the United States, unless it appears that the witness\'s absence was procured by the party offering the deposition;</item>
        <item>3(C) that the witness cannot attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</item>
        <item>3(D) that the party offering the deposition could not procure the witness\'s attendance by subpoena; or</item>
        <item>3(E) on motion and notice, that exceptional circumstances make it desirable—in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of live testimony in open court—to permit the deposition to be used.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Limitations on Use.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Deposition Taken on Short Notice.&lt;/i> A deposition must not be used against a party who, having received less than 14 days’ notice of the deposition, promptly moved for a protective order under Rule 26(c)(1)(B) requesting that it not be taken or be taken at a different time or place—and this motion was still pending when the deposition was taken.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Unavailable Deponent; Party Could Not Obtain an Attorney.&lt;/i> A deposition taken without leave of court under the unavailability provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(iii) must not be used against a party who shows that, when served with the notice, it could not, despite diligent efforts, obtain an attorney to represent it at the deposition.</item>
        <item>2(6) &lt;i>Using Part of a Deposition.&lt;/i> If a party offers in evidence only part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce other parts that in fairness should be considered with the part introduced, and any party may itself introduce any other parts.</item>
        <item>2(7) &lt;i>Substituting a Party.&lt;/i> Substituting a party under Rule 25 does not affect the right to use a deposition previously taken.</item>
        <item>2(8) &lt;i>Deposition Taken in an Earlier Action.&lt;/i> A deposition lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or state-court action may be used in a later action involving the same subject matter between the same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the later action. A deposition previously taken may also be used as allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</item>
        <item>1(b) OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY. Subject to Rules 28(b) and 32(d)(3), an objection may be made at a hearing or trial to the admission of any deposition testimony that would be inadmissible if the witness were present and testifying.</item>
        <item>1(c) FORM OF PRESENTATION. Unless the court orders otherwise, a party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony the party offers, but may provide the court with the testimony in nontranscript form as well. On any party\'s request, deposition testimony offered in a jury trial for any purpose other than impeachment must be presented in nontranscript form, if available, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.</item>

        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Objection to Competence, Relevance, or Materiality.&lt;/i> An objection to a deponent\'s competence—or to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony—is not waived by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Objection to an Error or Irregularity.&lt;/i> An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:</item>

        <item>4(ii) it is not timely made during the deposition.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Objection to a Written Question.&lt;/i> An objection to the form of a written question under Rule 31 is waived if not served in writing on the party submitting the question within the time for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a recross-question, within 7 days after being served with it.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>To Completing and Returning the Deposition.&lt;/i> An objection to how the officer transcribed the testimony—or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition—is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Scope.&lt;/i> A party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to:</item>
        <item>3(A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and</item>
        <item>3(B) the genuineness of any described documents.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Form; Copy of a Document.&lt;/i> Each matter must be separately stated. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Time to Respond; Effect of Not Responding.&lt;/i> A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Answer.&lt;/i> If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Objections.&lt;/i> The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial.</item>
        <item>2(6) &lt;i>Motion Regarding the Sufficiency of an Answer or Objection.&lt;/i> The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless the court finds an objection justified, it must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the court may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may defer its final decision until a pretrial conference or a specified time before trial. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to an award of expenses.</item>
        <item>1(b) EFFECT OF AN ADMISSION; WITHDRAWING OR AMENDING IT. A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. Subject to Rule 16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.</item>

        <item>1(a) MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING DISCLOSURE OR DISCOVERY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> On notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort to obtain it without court action.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Appropriate Court.&lt;/i> A motion for an order to a party must be made in the court where the action is pending. A motion for an order to a nonparty must be made in the court where the discovery is or will be taken.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Specific Motions.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>To Compel Disclosure.&lt;/i> If a party fails to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>To Compel a Discovery Response.&lt;/i> A party seeking discovery may move for an order compelling an answer, designation, production, or inspection. This motion may be made if:</item>
        <item>4(i) a deponent fails to answer a question asked under Rule 30 or 31;</item>
        <item>4(ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4);</item>
        <item>4(iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33; or</item>
        <item>4(iv) a party fails to respond that inspection will be permitted—or fails to permit inspection—as requested under Rule 34.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Related to a Deposition.&lt;/i> When taking an oral deposition, the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the examination before moving for an order.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response.&lt;/i> For purposes of this subdivision (a), an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Payment of Expenses; Protective Orders.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>If the Motion Is Granted (or Disclosure or Discovery Is Provided After Filing).&lt;/i> If the motion is granted—or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed—the court must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant\'s reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney\'s fees. But the court must not order this payment if:</item>
        <item>4(i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the opposing party\'s nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified; or</item>
        <item>4(iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>If the Motion Is Denied.&lt;/i> If the motion is denied, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to pay the party or deponent who opposed the motion its reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney\'s fees. But the court must not order this payment if the motion was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>If the Motion Is Granted in Part and Denied in Part.&lt;/i> If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses for the motion.</item>
        <item>1(b) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A COURT ORDER.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Deposition Is Taken.&lt;/i> If the court where the discovery is taken orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of court. If a deposition-related motion is transferred to the court where the action is pending, and that court orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of either the court where the discovery is taken or the court where the action is pending.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Action Is Pending.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>For Not Obeying a Discovery Order.&lt;/i> If a party or a party\'s officer, director, or managing agent—or a witness designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders. They may include the following:</item>
        <item>4(i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;</item>
        <item>4(ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence;</item>
        <item>4(iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part;</item>
        <item>4(iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;</item>
        <item>4(v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part;</item>
        <item>4(vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; or</item>
        <item>4(vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>For Not Producing a Person for Examination.&lt;/i> If a party fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to produce another person for examination, the court may issue any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)—(vi), unless the disobedient party shows that it cannot produce the other person.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Payment of Expenses.&lt;/i> Instead of or in addition to the orders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</item>
        <item>1(c) FAILURE TO DISCLOSE, TO SUPPLEMENT AN EARLIER RESPONSE, OR TO ADMIT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Failure to Disclose or Supplement.&lt;/i> If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:</item>
        <item>3(A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, caused by the failure;</item>
        <item>3(B) may inform the jury of the party\'s failure; and</item>
        <item>3(C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)—(vi).</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Failure to Admit.&lt;/i> If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the matter true, the requesting party may move that the party who failed to admit pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, incurred in making that proof. The court must so order unless:</item>
        <item>3(A) the request was held objectionable under Rule 36(a);</item>
        <item>3(B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance;</item>
        <item>3(C) the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground to believe that it might prevail on the matter; or</item>
        <item>3(D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</item>
        <item>1(d) PARTY\'S FAILURE TO ATTEND ITS OWN DEPOSITION, SERVE ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES, OR RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR INSPECTION.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Motion; Grounds for Sanctions.&lt;/i> The court where the action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if:</item>
        <item>4(i) a party or a party\'s officer, director, or managing agent—or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails, after being served with proper notice, to appear for that person\'s deposition; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) a party, after being properly served with interrogatories under Rule 33 or a request for inspection under Rule 34, fails to serve its answers, objections, or written response.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Certification.&lt;/i> A motion for sanctions for failing to answer or respond must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to act in an effort to obtain the answer or response without court action.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Unacceptable Excuse for Failing to Act.&lt;/i> A failure described in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground that the discovery sought was objectionable, unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c).</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Types of Sanctions.&lt;/i> Sanctions may include any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)—(vi). Instead of or in addition to these sanctions, the court must require the party failing to act, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</item>
        <item>1(e) FAILURE TO PROVIDE ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION. Absent exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions under these rules on a party for failing to provide electronically stored information lost as a result of the routine, good-faith operation of an electronic information system.</item>
        <item>1(f) FAILURE TO PARTICIPATE IN FRAMING A DISCOVERY PLAN. If a party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in developing and submitting a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require that party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees, caused by the failure.</item>

        <item>1&lt;b>Rule 38. Right to a Jury Trial; Demand&lt;/b></item>
        <item>1(a) RIGHT PRESERVED. The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution—or as provided by a federal statute—is preserved to the parties inviolate.</item>
        <item>1(b) DEMAND. On any issue triable of right by a jury, a party may demand a jury trial by:</item>
        <item>2(1) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served; and</item>
        <item>2(2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).</item>
        <item>1(c) SPECIFYING ISSUES. In its demand, a party may specify the issues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is considered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded a jury trial on only some issues, any other party may—within 14 days after being served with the demand or within a shorter time ordered by the court—serve a demand for a jury trial on any other or all factual issues triable by jury.</item>
        <item>1(d) WAIVER; WITHDRAWAL. A party waives a jury trial unless its demand is properly served and filed. A proper demand may be withdrawn only if the parties consent.</item>
        <item>1(e) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. These rules do not create a right to a jury trial on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h).</item>

        <item>1(a) WHEN A DEMAND IS MADE. When a jury trial has been demanded under Rule 38, the action must be designated on the docket as a jury action. The trial on all issues so demanded must be by jury unless:</item>
        <item>2(1) the parties or their attorneys file a stipulation to a nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or</item>
        <item>2(2) the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial.</item>
        <item>1(b) WHEN NO DEMAND IS MADE. Issues on which a jury trial is not properly demanded are to be tried by the court. But the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded.</item>
        <item>1(c) ADVISORY JURY; JURY TRIAL BY CONSENT. In an action not triable of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own:</item>
        <item>2(1) may try any issue with an advisory jury; or</item>
        <item>2(2) may, with the parties’ consent, try any issue by a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right, unless the action is against the United States and a federal statute provides for a nonjury trial.</item>

        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Without a Court Order.&lt;/i> Subject to Rules 23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing:</item>
        <item>4(i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Effect.&lt;/i> Unless the notice or stipulation states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice. But if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>By Court Order; Effect.&lt;/i> Except as provided in Rule 41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff\'s request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff\'s motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant\'s objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2) is without prejudice.</item>
        <item>1(b) INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL; EFFECT. If the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule—except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19—operates as an adjudication on the merits.</item>
        <item>1(c) DISMISSING A COUNTERCLAIM, CROSSCLAIM, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM. This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim. A claimant\'s voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made:</item>
        <item>2(1) before a responsive pleading is served; or</item>
        <item>2(2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is introduced at a hearing or trial.</item>
        <item>1(d) COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISMISSED ACTION. If a plaintiff who previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court:</item>
        <item>2(1) may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of that previous action; and</item>

        <item>2(1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions;</item>
        <item>2(2) consolidate the actions; or</item>

A final certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Other Means of Proof.&lt;/i> If all parties have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate a foreign record\'s authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either:</item>
        <item>4(i) admit an attested copy without final certification; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) permit the record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification.</item>
        <item>1(b) LACK OF A RECORD. A written statement that a diligent search of designated records revealed no record or entry of a specified tenor is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry. For domestic records, the statement must be authenticated under Rule 44(a)(1). For foreign records, the statement must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii).</item>
        <item>1(c) OTHER PROOF. A party may prove an official record—or an entry or lack of an entry in it—by any other method authorized by law.</item>

        <item>4(iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified time and place: attend and testify; produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person\'s possession, custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises; and</item>
        <item>4(iv) set out the text of Rule 45(d) and (e).</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Command to Attend a Deposition—Notice of the Recording Method.&lt;/i> A subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must state the method for recording the testimony.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored Information.&lt;/i> A command to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to permit the inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or may be set out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Command to Produce; Included Obligations.&lt;/i> A command in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the responding person to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Issuing Court.&lt;/i> A subpoena must issue from the court where the action is pending.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Issued by Whom.&lt;/i> The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a subpoena if the attorney is authorized to practice in the issuing court.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Notice to Other Parties Before Service.&lt;/i> If the subpoena commands the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises before trial, then before it is served on the person to whom it is directed, a notice and a copy of the subpoena must be served on each party.</item>
        <item>1(b) SERVICE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>By Whom and How; Tendering Fees.&lt;/i> Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person\'s attendance, tendering the fees for 1 day\'s attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena issues on behalf of the United States or any of its officers or agencies.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Service in the United States.&lt;/i> A subpoena may be served at any place within the United States.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Service in a Foreign Country.&lt;/i> 28 U.S.C. §1783 governs issuing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States national or resident who is in a foreign country.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Proof of Service.&lt;/i> Proving service, when necessary, requires filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of the persons served. The statement must be certified by the server.</item>
        <item>1(c) PLACE OF COMPLIANCE.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition.&lt;/i> A subpoena may command a person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows:</item>
        <item>3(A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person; or</item>
        <item>3(B) within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if the person</item>
        <item>4(i) is a party or a party\'s officer; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial expense.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>For Other Discovery.&lt;/i> A subpoena may command:</item>
        <item>3(A) production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person; and</item>
        <item>3(B) inspection of premises at the premises to be inspected.</item>
        <item>1(d) PROTECTING A PERSON SUBJECT TO A SUBPOENA; ENFORCEMENT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions.&lt;/i> A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction—which may include lost earnings and reasonable attorney\'s fees—on a party or attorney who fails to comply.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Appearance Not Required.&lt;/i> A person commanded to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or trial.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Objections.&lt;/i> A person commanded to produce documents or tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises—or to producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:</item>
        <item>4(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an order compelling production or inspection.</item>
        <item>4(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party\'s officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>When Required.&lt;/i> On timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that:</item>
        <item>4(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;</item>
        <item>4(ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c);</item>
        <item>4(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or</item>
        <item>4(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>When Permitted.&lt;/i> To protect a person subject to or affected by a subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:</item>
        <item>4(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) disclosing an unretained expert\'s opinion or information that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert\'s study that was not requested by a party.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Specifying Conditions as an Alternative.&lt;/i> In the circumstances described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified conditions if the serving party:</item>
        <item>4(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and</item>
        <item>4(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.</item>
        <item>1(e) DUTIES IN RESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information.&lt;/i> These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:</item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Documents.&lt;/i> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified.&lt;/i> If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form.&lt;/i> The person responding need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information.&lt;/i> The person responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Claiming Privilege or Protection.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Information Withheld.&lt;/i> A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must:</item>
        <item>4(i) expressly make the claim; and</item>
        <item>4(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Information Produced.&lt;/i> If information produced in response to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information under seal to the court for the district where compliance is required for a determination of the claim. The person who produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.</item>
        <item>1(f) TRANSFERRING A SUBPOENA-RELATED MOTION. When the court where compliance is required did not issue the subpoena, it may transfer a motion under this rule to the issuing court if the person subject to the subpoena consents or if the court finds exceptional circumstances. Then, if the attorney for a person subject to a subpoena is authorized to practice in the court where the motion was made, the attorney may file papers and appear on the motion as an officer of the issuing court. To enforce its order, the issuing court may transfer the order to the court where the motion was made.</item>
        <item>1(g) CONTEMPT. The court for the district where compliance is required — and also, after a motion is transferred, the issuing court — may hold in contempt a person who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena or an order related to it.</item>

        <item>1(a) SPECIAL VERDICT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding on each issue of fact. The court may do so by:</item>
        <item>3(A) submitting written questions susceptible of a categorical or other brief answer;</item>

If the party does not demand submission, the court may make a finding on the issue. If the court makes no finding, it is considered to have made a finding consistent with its judgment on the special verdict.</item>
        <item>1(b) GENERAL VERDICT WITH ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> The court may submit to the jury forms for a general verdict, together with written questions on one or more issues of fact that the jury must decide.

        <item>1(a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:</item>
        <item>3(A) resolve the issue against the party; and</item>
        <item>3(B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Motion.&lt;/i> A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. The motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.</item>
        <item>1(b) RENEWING THE MOTION AFTER TRIAL; ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court\'s later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment—or if the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged—the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on the renewed motion, the court may:</item>
        <item>2(1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a verdict;</item>
        <item>2(2) order a new trial; or</item>

The court must state the grounds for conditionally granting or denying the motion for a new trial.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Effect of a Conditional Ruling.&lt;/i> Conditionally granting the motion for a new trial does not affect the judgment\'s finality; if the judgment is reversed, the new trial must proceed unless the appellate court orders otherwise. If the motion for a new trial is conditionally denied, the appellee may assert error in that denial; if the judgment is reversed, the case must proceed as the appellate court orders.</item>
        <item>1(d) TIME FOR A LOSING PARTY\'S NEW-TRIAL MOTION. Any motion for a new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a matter of law is rendered must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.</item>
        <item>1(e) DENYING THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW; REVERSAL ON APPEAL. If the court denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the prevailing party may, as appellee, assert grounds entitling it to a new trial should the appellate court conclude that the trial court erred in denying the motion. If the appellate court reverses the judgment, it may order a new trial, direct the trial court to determine whether a new trial should be granted, or direct the entry of judgment.</item>

    <item>2(2) &lt;i>When to Make.&lt;/i> An objection is timely if:</item>
    <item>3(A) a party objects at the opportunity provided under Rule 51(b)(2); or</item>
    <item>3(B) a party was not informed of an instruction or action on a request before that opportunity to object, and the party objects promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused.</item>
    <item>1(d) ASSIGNING ERROR; PLAIN ERROR.</item>
    <item>2(1) &lt;i>Assigning Error.&lt;/i> A party may assign as error:</item>
    <item>3(A) an error in an instruction actually given, if that party properly objected; or</item>
    <item>3(B) a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly requested it and—unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record—also properly objected.</item>
    <item>2(2) &lt;i>Plain Error.&lt;/i> A court may consider a plain error in the instructions that has not been preserved as required by Rule 51(d)(1) if the error affects substantial rights.</item>

    <item>1&lt;b>Rule 52. Findings and Conclusions by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings&lt;/b></item>
    <item>1(a) FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS.</item>
    <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court. Judgment must be entered under Rule 58</item>
    <item>2(2) &lt;i>For an Interlocutory Injunction.&lt;/i> In granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly state the findings and conclusions that support its action.</item>
    <item>2(3) &lt;i>For a Motion.&lt;/i> The court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or 56 or, unless these rules provide otherwise, on any other motion.</item>
    <item>2(4) &lt;i>Effect of a Master\'s Findings.&lt;/i> A master\'s findings, to the extent adopted by the court, must be considered the court\'s findings.</item>
    <item>2(5) &lt;i>Questioning the Evidentiary Support.&lt;/i> A party may later question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings, whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</item>
    <item>2(6) &lt;i>Setting Aside the Findings.&lt;/i> Findings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court\'s opportunity to judge the witnesses’ credibility.</item>
    <item>1(b) AMENDED OR ADDITIONAL FINDINGS. On a party\'s motion filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings—or make additional findings—and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.</item>
    <item>1(c) JUDGMENT ON PARTIAL FINDINGS. If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue. The court may, however, decline to render any judgment until the close of the evidence. A judgment on partial findings must be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).</item>

        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Disqualification.&lt;/i> A master must not have a relationship to the parties, attorneys, action, or court that would require disqualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00A7455, unless the parties, with the court\'s approval, consent to the appointment after the master discloses any potential grounds for disqualification.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Possible Expense or Delay.&lt;/i> In appointing a master, the court must consider the fairness of imposing the likely expenses on the parties and must protect against unreasonable expense or delay.</item>
        <item>1(b) ORDER APPOINTING A MASTER.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Notice.&lt;/i> Before appointing a master, the court must give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard. Any party may suggest candidates for appointment.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Contents.&lt;/i> The appointing order must direct the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence and must state:</item>
        <item>3(A) the master\'s duties, including any investigation or enforcement duties, and any limits on the master\'s authority under Rule 53(c);</item>
        <item>3(B) the circumstances, if any, in which the master may communicate ex parte with the court or a party;</item>

        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Issuing.&lt;/i> The court may issue the order only after:</item>
        <item>3(A) the master files an affidavit disclosing whether there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. \u00A7455; and</item>

        <item>1(c) MASTER\'S AUTHORITY.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General&lt;/i>. Unless the appointing order directs otherwise, a master may:</item>
        <item>3(A) regulate all proceedings;</item>
        <item>3(B) take all appropriate measures to perform the assigned duties fairly and efficiently; and</item>
        <item>3(C) if conducting an evidentiary hearing, exercise the appointing court\'s power to compel, take, and record evidence.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Sanctions.&lt;/i> The master may by order impose on a party any noncontempt sanction provided by Rule 37 or 45, and may recommend a contempt sanction against a party and sanctions against a nonparty.</item>
        <item>1(d) MASTER\'S ORDERS. A master who issues an order must file it and promptly serve a copy on each party. The clerk must enter the order on the docket.</item>
        <item>1(e) MASTER\'S REPORTS. A master must report to the court as required by the appointing order. The master must file the report and promptly serve a copy on each party, unless the court orders otherwise.</item>
        <item>1(f) ACTION ON THE MASTER\'S ORDER, REPORT, OR RECOMMENDATIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Opportunity for a Hearing; Action in General.&lt;/i> In acting on a master\'s order, report, or recommendations, the court must give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard; may receive evidence; and may adopt or affirm, modify, wholly or partly reject or reverse, or resubmit to the master with instructions.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Time to Object or Move to Adopt or Modify.&lt;/i> A party may file objections to—or a motion to adopt or modify—the master\'s order, report, or recommendations no later than 21 days after a copy is served, unless the court sets a different time.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Reviewing Factual Findings.&lt;/i> The court must decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made or recommended by a master, unless the parties, with the court\'s approval, stipulate that:</item>
        <item>3(A) the findings will be reviewed for clear error; or</item>
        <item>3(B) the findings of a master appointed under Rule 53(a)(1)(A) or (C) will be final.</item>

        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Reviewing Procedural Matters.&lt;/i> Unless the appointing order establishes a different standard of review, the court may set aside a master\'s ruling on a procedural matter only for an abuse of discretion.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Fixing Compensation.&lt;/i> Before or after judgment, the court must fix the master\'s compensation on the basis and terms stated in the appointing order, but the court may set a new basis and terms after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Payment.&lt;/i> The compensation must be paid either:</item>
        <item>3(A) by a party or parties; or</item>
        <item>3(B) from a fund or subject matter of the action within the court\'s control.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Allocating Payment.&lt;/i> The court must allocate payment among the parties after considering the nature and amount of the controversy, the parties’ means, and the extent to which any party is more responsible than other parties for the reference to a master. An interim allocation may be amended to reflect a decision on the merits.</item>
        <item>1(h) APPOINTING A MAGISTRATE JUDGE. A magistrate judge is subject to this rule only when the order referring a matter to the magistrate judge states that the reference is made under this rule.</item>

        <item>1&lt;b>Rule 54. Judgment; Costs&lt;/b></item>
        <item>1(a) DEFINITION; FORM. “Judgment” as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment should not include recitals of pleadings, a master\'s report, or a record of prior proceedings.</item>
        <item>1(b) JUDGMENT ON MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR INVOLVING MULTIPLE PARTIES. When an action presents more than one claim for relief—whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim—or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.</item>
        <item>1(c) DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT; RELIEF TO BE GRANTED. A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.</item>
        <item>1(d) COSTS; ATTORNEY\'S FEES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Costs Other Than Attorney\'s Fees.&lt;/i> Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney\'s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk may tax costs on 14 days’ notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk\'s action.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Attorney\'s Fees.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Claim to Be by Motion&lt;/i>. A claim for attorney\'s fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Timing and Contents of the Motion.&lt;/i> Unless a statute or a court order provides otherwise, the motion must:</item>
        <item>4(i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment;</item>
        <item>4(ii) specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the movant to the award;</item>
        <item>4(iii) state the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of it; and</item>
        <item>4(iv) disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is made.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Proceedings.&lt;/i> Subject to Rule 23(h), the court must, on a party\'s request, give an opportunity for adversary submissions on the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or 78. The court may decide issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions on the value of services. The court must find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a).</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Special Procedures by Local Rule; Reference to a Master or a Magistrate Judge.&lt;/i> By local rule, the court may establish special procedures to resolve fee-related issues without extensive evidentiary hearings. Also, the court may refer issues concerning the value of services to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the limitations of Rule 53(a)(1), and may refer a motion for attorney\'s fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter.</item>
        <item>3(E) &lt;i>Exceptions.&lt;/i> Subparagraphs (A)–(D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violating these rules or as sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00A71927.</item>

        <item>1(a) ENTERING A DEFAULT. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party\'s default.</item>
        <item>1(b) ENTERING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>By the Clerk.&lt;/i> If the plaintiff\'s claim is for a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, the clerk—on the plaintiff\'s request, with an affidavit showing the amount due—must enter judgment for that amount and costs against a defendant who has been defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor an incompetent person.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>By the Court.&lt;/i> In all other cases, the party must apply to the court for a default judgment. A default judgment may be entered against a minor or incompetent person only if represented by a general guardian, conservator, or other like fiduciary who has appeared. If the party against whom a default judgment is sought has appeared personally or by a representative, that party or its representative must be served with written notice of the application at least 7 days before the hearing.

        <item>1(a) MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT. A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.</item>
        <item>1(b) TIME TO FILE A MOTION. Unless a different time is set by local rule or the court orders otherwise, a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all discovery.</item>
        <item>1(c) PROCEDURES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Supporting Factual Positions&lt;/i>. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:</item>
        <item>3(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or</item>
        <item>3(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Objection That a Fact Is Not Supported by Admissible Evidence.&lt;/i> A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Materials Not Cited.&lt;/i> The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Affidavits or Declarations.&lt;/i> An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.</item>
        <item>1(d) WHEN FACTS ARE UNAVAILABLE TO THE NONMOVANT. If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:</item>

        <item>2(2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or</item>
        <item>2(3) issue any other appropriate order.</item>
        <item>1(e) FAILING TO PROPERLY SUPPORT OR ADDRESS A FACT. If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party’s assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may:</item>
        <item>2(1) give an opportunity to properly support or address the fact;</item>
        <item>2(2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion;</item>
        <item>2(3) grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials — including the facts considered undisputed — show that the movant is entitled to it; or</item>
        <item>2(4) issue any other appropriate order.</item>
        <item>1(f) &lt;i>Judgment Independent of the Motion.&lt;/i> After giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, the court may:</item>

        <item>2(2) grant the motion on grounds not raised by a party;or</item>
        <item>2(3) consider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.</item>
        <item>1(g) FAILING TO GRANT ALL THE REQUESTED RELIEF. If the court does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, it may enter an order stating any material fact — including an item of damages or other relief — that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case.</item>
        <item>1(h) AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION SUBMITTED IN BAD FAITH. If satisfied that an affidavit or declaration under this rule is submitted in bad faith or solely for delay, the court — after notice and a reasonable time to respond — may order the submitting party to pay the other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, it incurred as a result. An offending party or attorney may also be held in contempt or subjected to other appropriate sanctions.</item>

The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice. But after an appeal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is pending, such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate court\'s leave.</item>

Except as stated in this rule, no execution may issue on a judgment, nor may proceedings be taken to enforce it, until 14 days have passed after its entry. But unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:</item>

        <item>1(c) INJUNCTION PENDING AN APPEAL. While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party\'s rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:</item>
        <item>2(1) by that court sitting in open session; or</item>
        <item>2(2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their signatures.</item>
        <item>1(d) STAY WITH BOND ON APPEAL. If an appeal is taken, the appellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond, except in an action described in Rule 62(a)(1) or (2). The bond may be given upon or after filing the notice of appeal or after obtaining the order allowing the appeal. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond.</item>
        <item>1(e) STAY WITHOUT BOND ON AN APPEAL BY THE UNITED STATES, ITS OFFICERS, OR ITS AGENCIES. The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal government.</item>
        <item>1(f) STAY IN FAVOR OF A JUDGMENT DEBTOR UNDER STATE LAW. If a judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor\'s property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.</item>
        <item>1(g) APPELLATE COURT\'S POWER NOT LIMITED. This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:</item>
        <item>2(1) to stay proceedings—or suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction—while an appeal is pending; or</item>
        <item>2(2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.</item>
        <item>1(h) STAY WITH MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR PARTIES. A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.</item>

If a judgment requires a party to convey land, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be done—at the disobedient party\'s expense—by another person appointed by the court.

        <item>1(a) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER RULES. These rules govern proceedings to condemn real and personal property by eminent domain, except as this rule provides otherwise.</item>
        <item>1(b) JOINDER OF PROPERTIES. The plaintiff may join separate pieces of property in a single action, no matter whether they are owned by the same persons or sought for the same use.</item>
        <item>1(c) COMPLAINT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Caption.&lt;/i> The complaint must contain a caption as provided in Rule 10(a). The plaintiff must, however, name as defendants both the property—designated generally by kind, quantity, and location—and at least one owner of some part of or interest in the property.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Contents.&lt;/i> The complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the following:</item>
        <item>3(A) the authority for the taking;</item>
        <item>3(B) the uses for which the property is to be taken;</item>
        <item>3(C) a description sufficient to identify the property;</item>
        <item>3(D) the interests to be acquired; and</item>
        <item>3(E) for each piece of property, a designation of each defendant who has been joined as an owner or owner of an interest in it.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Parties.&lt;/i> When the action commences, the plaintiff need join as defendants only those persons who have or claim an interest in the property and whose names are then known. But before any hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have become known or can be found by a reasonably diligent search of the records, considering both the property\'s character and value and the interests to be acquired. All others may be made defendants under the designation “Unknown Owners.”</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Procedure.&lt;/i> Notice must be served on all defendants as provided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named as defendants when the action commenced or were added later. A defendant may answer as provided in Rule 71.1(e). The court, meanwhile, may order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Filing; Additional Copies.&lt;/i> In addition to filing the complaint, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy for the defendants’ use and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant.</item>
        <item>1(d) PROCESS.</item>
        <item>2(1) DELIVERING NOTICE TO THE CLERK. On filing a complaint, the plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or several notices directed to the named defendants. When adding defendants, the plaintiff must deliver to the clerk additional notices directed to the new defendants.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Contents of the Notice.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Main Contents.&lt;/i> Each notice must name the court, the title of the action, and the defendant to whom it is directed. It must describe the property sufficiently to identify it, but need not describe any property other than that to be taken from the named defendant. The notice must also state:</item>
        <item>4(i) that the action is to condemn property;</item>
        <item>4(ii) the interest to be taken;</item>
        <item>4(iii) the authority for the taking;</item>
        <item>4(iv) the uses for which the property is to be taken;</item>
        <item>4(v) that the defendant may serve an answer on the plaintiff\'s attorney within 21 days after being served with the notice;</item>
        <item>4(vi) that the failure to so serve an answer constitutes consent to the taking and to the court\'s authority to proceed with the action and fix the compensation; and</item>
        <item>4(vii) that a defendant who does not serve an answer may file a notice of appearance.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Conclusion.&lt;/i> The notice must conclude with the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the plaintiff\'s attorney and an address within the district in which the action is brought where the attorney may be served.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Serving the Notice.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Personal Service.&lt;/i> When a defendant whose address is known resides within the United States or a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, personal service of the notice (without a copy of the complaint) must be made in accordance with Rule 4.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Service by Publication.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>4(i) A defendant may be served by publication only when the plaintiff\'s attorney files a certificate stating that the attorney believes the defendant cannot be personally served, because after diligent inquiry within the state where the complaint is filed, the defendant\'s place of residence is still unknown or, if known, that it is beyond the territorial limits of personal service. Service is then made by publishing the notice—once a week for at least 3 successive weeks—in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located or, if there is no such newspaper, in a newspaper with general circulation where the property is located. Before the last publication, a copy of the notice must also be mailed to every defendant who cannot be personally served but whose place of residence is then known. Unknown owners may be served by publication in the same manner by a notice addressed to “Unknown Owners.”</item>
        <item>4(ii) Service by publication is complete on the date of the last publication. The plaintiff\'s attorney must prove publication and mailing by a certificate, attach a printed copy of the published notice, and mark on the copy the newspaper\'s name and the dates of publication.</item>
        <item>3(4) &lt;i>Effect of Delivery and Service.&lt;/i> Delivering the notice to the clerk and serving it have the same effect as serving a summons under Rule 4.</item>
        <item>3(5) &lt;i>Amending the Notice; Proof of Service and Amending the Proof.&lt;/i> Rule 4(a)(2) governs amending the notice. Rule 4(l) governs proof of service and amending it.</item>
        <item>1(e) APPEARANCE OR ANSWER.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Notice of Appearance.&lt;/i> A defendant that has no objection or defense to the taking of its property may serve a notice of appearance designating the property in which it claims an interest. The defendant must then be given notice of all later proceedings affecting the defendant.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Answer.&lt;/i> A defendant that has an objection or defense to the taking must serve an answer within 21 days after being served with the notice. The answer must:</item>
        <item>3(A) identify the property in which the defendant claims an interest;</item>
        <item>3(B) state the nature and extent of the interest; and</item>
        <item>3(C) state all the defendant\'s objections and defenses to the taking.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Waiver of Other Objections and Defenses; Evidence on Compensation.&lt;/i> A defendant waives all objections and defenses not stated in its answer. No other pleading or motion asserting an additional objection or defense is allowed. But at the trial on compensation, a defendant—whether or not it has previously appeared or answered—may present evidence on the amount of compensation to be paid and may share in the award.</item>
        <item>1(f) AMENDING PLEADINGS. Without leave of court, the plaintiff may—as often as it wants—amend the complaint at any time before the trial on compensation. But no amendment may be made if it would result in a dismissal inconsistent with Rule 71.1(i)(1) or (2). The plaintiff need not serve a copy of an amendment, but must serve notice of the filing, as provided in Rule 5(b), on every affected party who has appeared and, as provided in Rule 71.1(d), on every affected party who has not appeared. In addition, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy of each amendment for the defendants’ use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant. A defendant may appear or answer in the time and manner and with the same effect as provided in Rule 71.1(e).</item>
        <item>1(g) SUBSTITUTING PARTIES. If a defendant dies, becomes incompetent, or transfers an interest after being joined, the court may, on motion and notice of hearing, order that the proper party be substituted. Service of the motion and notice on a nonparty must be made as provided in Rule 71.1(d)(3).</item>
        <item>1(h) TRIAL OF THE ISSUES.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Issues Other Than Compensation; Compensation.&lt;/i> In an action involving eminent domain under federal law, the court tries all issues, including compensation, except when compensation must be determined:</item>
        <item>3(A) by any tribunal specially constituted by a federal statute to determine compensation; or</item>
        <item>3(B) if there is no such tribunal, by a jury when a party demands one within the time to answer or within any additional time the court sets, unless the court appoints a commission.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Appointing a Commission; Commission\'s Powers and Report.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>Reasons for Appointing.&lt;/i> If a party has demanded a jury, the court may instead appoint a three-person commission to determine compensation because of the character, location, or quantity of the property to be condemned or for other just reasons.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Alternate Commissioners.&lt;/i> The court may appoint up to two additional persons to serve as alternate commissioners to hear the case and replace commissioners who, before a decision is filed, the court finds unable or disqualified to perform their duties. Once the commission renders its final decision, the court must discharge any alternate who has not replaced a commissioner.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>Examining the Prospective Commissioners.&lt;/i> Before making its appointments, the court must advise the parties of the identity and qualifications of each prospective commissioner and alternate, and may permit the parties to examine them. The parties may not suggest appointees, but for good cause may object to a prospective commissioner or alternate.</item>
        <item>3(D) &lt;i>Commission\'s Powers and Report.&lt;/i> A commission has the powers of a master under Rule 53(c). Its action and report are determined by a majority. Rule 53(d), (e), and (f) apply to its action and report.</item>
        <item>1(i) DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION OR A DEFENDANT.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Dismissing the Action.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>By the Plaintiff.&lt;/i> If no compensation hearing on a piece of property has begun, and if the plaintiff has not acquired title or a lesser interest or taken possession, the plaintiff may, without a court order, dismiss the action as to that property by filing a notice of dismissal briefly describing the property.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>By Stipulation.&lt;/i> Before a judgment is entered vesting the plaintiff with title or a lesser interest in or possession of property, the plaintiff and affected defendants may, without a court order, dismiss the action in whole or in part by filing a stipulation of dismissal. And if the parties so stipulate, the court may vacate a judgment already entered.</item>
        <item>3(C) &lt;i>By Court Order.&lt;/i> At any time before compensation has been determined and paid, the court may, after a motion and hearing, dismiss the action as to a piece of property. But if the plaintiff has already taken title, a lesser interest, or possession as to any part of it, the court must award compensation for the title, lesser interest, or possession taken.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Dismissing a Defendant.&lt;/i> The court may at any time dismiss a defendant who was unnecessarily or improperly joined.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Effect.&lt;/i> A dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order.</item>
        <item>1(j) DEPOSIT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Deposit.&lt;/i> The plaintiff must deposit with the court any money required by law as a condition to the exercise of eminent domain and may make a deposit when allowed by statute.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Distribution; Adjusting Distribution.&lt;/i> After a deposit, the court and attorneys must expedite the proceedings so as to distribute the deposit and to determine and pay compensation. If the compensation finally awarded to a defendant exceeds the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against the plaintiff for the deficiency. If the compensation awarded to a defendant is less than the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against that defendant for the overpayment.</item>
        <item>1(k) CONDEMNATION UNDER A STATE\'S POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. This rule governs an action involving eminent domain under state law. But if state law provides for trying an issue by jury—or for trying the issue of compensation by jury or commission or both—that law governs.</item>
        <item>1(l) COSTS. Costs are not subject to Rule 54(d).</item>

A party may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to.

To signify their consent, the parties must jointly or separately file a statement consenting to the referral. A district judge or magistrate judge may be informed of a party\'s response to the clerk\'s notice only if all parties have consented to the referral.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Reminding the Parties About Consenting.&lt;/i> A district judge, magistrate judge, or other court official may remind the parties of the magistrate judge\'s availability, but must also advise them that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.</item>

The provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00A71451 for service by publication and for answer apply in proceedings to cancel citizenship certificates.</item>
        <item>2(4) &lt;i>Special Writs.&lt;/i> These rules apply to proceedings for habeas corpus and for quo warranto to the extent that the practice in those proceedings:</item>
        <item>3(A) is not specified in a federal statute, the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, or the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases; and</item>
        <item>3(B) has previously conformed to the practice in civil actions.</item>
        <item>2(5) &lt;i>Proceedings Involving a Subpoena.&lt;/i> These rules apply to proceedings to compel testimony or the production of documents through a subpoena issued by a United States officer or agency under a federal statute, except as otherwise provided by statute, by local rule, or by court order in the proceedings.</item>
        <item>2(6) &lt;i>Other Proceedings.&lt;/i> These rules, to the extent applicable, govern proceedings under the following laws, except as these laws provide other procedures:</item>
        <item>3(A) 7 U.S.C. \u00A7\u00A7292, 499g(c), for reviewing an order of the Secretary of Agriculture;</item>
        <item>3(B) 9 U.S.C., relating to arbitration;</item>

        <item>1(b) SCIRE FACIAS AND MANDAMUS. The writs of scire facias and mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them may be obtained by appropriate action or motion under these rules.</item>
        <item>1(c) REMOVED ACTIONS.</item>
        <item>2(1) &lt;i>Applicability.&lt;/i> These rules apply to a civil action after it is removed from a state court.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Further Pleading.&lt;/i> After removal, repleading is unnecessary unless the court orders it. A defendant who did not answer before removal must answer or present other defenses or objections under these rules within the longest of these periods:</item>
        <item>3(A) 21 days after receiving—through service or otherwise—a copy of the initial pleading stating the claim for relief;</item>
        <item>3(B) 21 days after being served with the summons for an initial pleading on file at the time of service; or</item>
        <item>3(C) 7 days after the notice of removal is filed.</item>
        <item>2(3) &lt;i>Demand for a Jury Trial.&lt;/i></item>
        <item>3(A) &lt;i>As Affected by State Law.&lt;/i> A party who, before removal, expressly demanded a jury trial in accordance with state law need not renew the demand after removal. If the state law did not require an express demand for a jury trial, a party need not make one after removal unless the court orders the parties to do so within a specified time. The court must so order at a party\'s request and may so order on its own. A party who fails to make a demand when so ordered waives a jury trial.</item>
        <item>3(B) &lt;i>Under Rule 38.&lt;/i> If all necessary pleadings have been served at the time of removal, a party entitled to a jury trial under Rule 38 must be given one if the party serves a demand within 14 days after:</item>
        <item>4(i) it files a notice of removal; or</item>
        <item>4(ii) it is served with a notice of removal filed by another party.</item>

        <item>2(1) &lt;i>In General.&lt;/i> After giving public notice and an opportunity for comment, a district court, acting by a majority of its district judges, may adopt and amend rules governing its practice. A local rule must be consistent with—but not duplicate—federal statutes and rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. \u00A7\u00A72072 and 2075, and must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A local rule takes effect on the date specified by the district court and remains in effect unless amended by the court or abrogated by the judicial council of the circuit. Copies of rules and amendments must, on their adoption, be furnished to the judicial council and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and be made available to the public.</item>
        <item>2(2) &lt;i>Requirement of Form.&lt;/i> A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.</item>

A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. \u00A7\u00A72072 and 2075, and the district\'s local rules. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</item>
